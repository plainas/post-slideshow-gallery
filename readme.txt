Post slideshow gallery is a barebones plugins that displays post's pictures on a slideshow.

== Description ==

This is a very barebones plugin, it aims to do one thing well and nothing else. There are no fancy extra features. Just insert [postslideshow] on your post content where you want the slideshow to appear and you're good to go. All the pictures of the current post will be included in the slideshow. 

The dimensions of the gallery can be configured in the options menu.

== Installation ==

Follow the standard wordpress plugin installation procedure. I.e. copy the plugin to the plugins folder and activate on the admin panel.

Or, as an alternative, simply install from the plugin manager.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I display multiple galleries in the same page? =

Yes, that was a reason this plugin was created, there was no decent slideshow plugin that would do that, so this post-slideshow-gallery was created.

= Can I change the look and feel of the slideshow? =

That feature is not suported. The only available settings are the slideshow dimmensions. Considering the size of this plugin code base I would recomend you to modify (a fork of) this plugin directly. Using another galleria theme should be an easy peasy if you know some basic PHP.
